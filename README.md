# NextJs
ðŸš§ Work in Progress
- This project is still in development. Feel free to modify and customize it for your own needs. All the files uploaded are half baked. You can modify them and design it with your own style or use it as a template for a portofolio website using NextJs

# About the Project
This is my first project using Next.js, a React framework for building modern web applications. It serves as a simple portfolio template but can be extended into a full CRUD app in the future.

## Features (so far):
- ðŸ“„ Simple page structure
- ðŸŽ¨ Basic styling (Tailwind CSS)
- ðŸš€ Ready for further development

### This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Vtolin/NextJsx.git  
cd NextJs
```
Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Run the project:
```
npm run dev  
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
